# bgrep
Binary Grep Tool (exploration)

At times  I have found  a need  to have a  `grep` tool that  can natively
process binary data, while still  searching for desired patterns (literal
or Regular Expressions).

With various communications projects  (zeotools) and older class projects
(UNIX Data Recovery), there were also formats of data I wanted to be able
to have picked out and displayed in hexadecimal to the screen.

This tool  is an older  attempt to explore  the implementation of  such a
tool. The integration of the  Regular Expression processing currently has
it broken.

It also served as an opportunity to explore the creation and authoring of
UNIX manual  pages. The tool  has an expansive  manual page, even  if the
code does not currently support all the desired options.
